      Here at Salmon Cookies we strive to be innovators. In that pursuit we found that there was a drought in the cookie market, specifically for cookies in the shape of fishes.
      To make matters worse, there weren't any fish FLAVORED cookies in the first place. But with our revolutionary product, we were able to combine both of those gaps in the market
      and present to you, the user, our Salmon Cookies.

    <h2> Why have we done this?</h2>
    <p>
      Now like any reasonable human being, we had no clue why there were these blatant holes in the cookie market. And by <a href="sales.html">these</a> numbers, a lot of other people
      are happy we did it.
